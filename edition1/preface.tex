\chapter*{Preface}

Writing a preface before completing the work is not a good idea.  So I
defer writing the real preface.  I will rewrite this preface once the
book reach a good shape with solid content.

I welcome your corrections and feedback now!  Please have a look at
the LaTeX source here: \url{https://github.com/baijum/pyguide}.  You
can also use the issue tracker given there to submit suggestions or
